To get everything set up, and to produce the graph I did, do the folowing:

1. For safety, create a foler named 'text_files' where you plan to run the code.
I know I can do that automatically, but that wasn't actually implimented when I finished
the code before class.

2. Run the functions in this order:
	-Worm_downloader.py
	-create_plaintext.py
	-sentiment_analysis.py
	-sentiment_grapher.py

3. Enjoy the graph. If you actually chose to download everything, because that takes a little bit.
